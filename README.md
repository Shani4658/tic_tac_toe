This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic implementation of the popular two-player game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a clean and responsive interface, ensuring an enjoyable experience on both small and large screens. Users can alternate turns to place "X" and "O" on the grid, with a dynamic display showing whose turn it is. The game includes a reset button to restart the match and an animated line that highlights the winning combination. An interactive and user-friendly design makes this project a great addition to your portfolio.
